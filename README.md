# Todo App

A Todo application built with React that allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize tasks across different stages: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". The app uses React's state management, React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality, and integrates with `react-hot-toast` for notifications.

## Features

- **Create Todo Items**: Users can add new tasks (todos) with custom names.
- **Drag and Drop**: Tasks can be moved between the "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" sections using drag-and-drop.
- **Edit Todo Items**: Users can update the name of any task.
- **Delete Todo Items**: Users can delete tasks after confirming the action.
- **Todo Organization**: Tasks are automatically categorized based on their status and displayed in separate sections for easy management.
- **Notifications**: Success and error messages are shown using `react-hot-toast`.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React DnD**: For drag-and-drop functionality.
- **react-hot-toast**: For notifications.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: For styling the UI with utility-first classes.
- **UUID**: For generating unique IDs for tasks.
